# skinlesionsegmentation
In this project, a deep learning model has been adapted for the segmentation of skin lesions. This work demonstrates the segmentation of skin lesions using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) that train skin lesion images from end-to-end using only the images pixels and disease ground truth labels as inputs. The fully convolutional network adapted is based on U-Net architecture. The model is enhanced by employing multi-stage segmentation approach with batch normalisation and data augmentation. Performance metrics such as dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were used for evaluating the performance of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved better performance compared with the other state-of-the arts methods for skin lesion image segmentation with a dice coefficient of 90% and sensitivity of 96%.
